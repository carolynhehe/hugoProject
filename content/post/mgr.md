## Design Context
My GoodReal is a platform designed to enable real estate brokers to create and customize their own websites. By connecting with MLSÂ® Listings, it allows brokers to showcase their properties directly on their site, and also includes CRM and other functionalities. 

Many brokers lack experience in website design, set up domain, and server management. Their main goal is to showcase their personal brand and provide clients with real-time updates on available properties. As a UX designer, my objective is to help brokers quickly and efficiently onboard this software where to design and launch their websites, and achieve their business goals.

## 2B Product - Minimum engage time
This project involves a deep understanding of the real estate industry, the unique needs and limitations of brokers, and the technical capabilities of the My GoodReal platform. By providing a streamlined and user-friendly design, I aim to simplify the complex process of website creation and empower brokers to establish a strong online presence. 

Through effective communication and collaboration, I worked closely with brokers to ensure that they can quickly onboard the product, and ensure the design aligns with their vision. Ultimately, my goal is to enable brokers to leverage technology to drive their business forward.


## Improvement 1: a Quick Start Tour section
### Problem

In preparation for the design iteration, we integrated My GoodReal with Zendesk, a leading help desk management solution. Through user feedback, we gained valuable insights into the challenges that many realtors were experiencing, particularly when it came to purchasing or setting up their domain.
### Solution

To address this challenge, we recognized the need for a more streamlined and user-friendly onboarding process. Our team worked to break down the process into smaller, more manageable goals, providing users with clear and measurable milestones to work towards. This approach was designed to help users stay focused and motivated, while also making the overall process less daunting and overwhelming.

Overall, the integration with Zendesk and the new onboarding process was a critical step in improving the onboarding user experience of My GoodReal.

## Improvement 2: redesign the Dashboard
### Problem
I was tasked with redesigning the Dashboard for My GoodReal, with the goals of increasing efficiency for both new and returning users. The existing Dashboard was outdated, with a cluttered and overwhelming page layout and unintuitive user flow, which was affecting both user efficiency and the business's scalability.

### Solution
We identified the need for a more concise and well-organized page layout, with clear and intuitive navigation, to help users quickly find the features they need and complete tasks efficiently.

Overall, our redesign of the My GoodReal Dashboard was driven by a user-centered approach, with a focus on improving usability and efficiency for both new and returning users. The result is a more modern, intuitive, and efficient Dashboard that is better equipped to meet the needs of our target audience.&nbsp;

Our redesigned Dashboard features a clean and modern UI, with a simplified page layout and clear visual hierarchy. Key features and functions are prominently displayed, with easy-to-navigate menus and clear calls to action. We also introduced easy shortcuts, new visualized data and the flexible components. 

## Improvement 3: more intuitive UI
To have more intuitive UI, we identified pages in the product that required improvement by focusing on the following aspects:

### Paying Page

### Profile Page

I highlighted the info groups in the "BEFORE"s, and the improvements of the UI can be seen through the comparison images. My approach involved reducing the number of information groups and optimizing the screen area layout to achieve an ideal content density. We also aimed to reduce mouse movement distance by increasing the number of no-scrolling pages.

Through my redesign efforts, we were able to create a more streamlined and intuitive user interface, with key features and functions more easily accessible to users. Our improvements to the paying page and profile page not only enhanced the overall user experience, but also contributed to increased efficiency and productivity for real estate broker users.
