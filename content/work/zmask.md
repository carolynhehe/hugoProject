## DESIGN FICTION
As a starting point for our designs we will use design fiction, which is â€œan approach to design that **speculates about new ideas through prototyping and storytelling**. We will use design fiction as a tool to help us not only theorizing about future and possible worlds, but to allow ourselves to unapologetically design for them.

We envision a high tech communicty where instant gratification is of our most importance to the everday consumers of makeup products. Ease and speed is of essence to them.

## PRODUCT IDEATION
We have seen a rise in subscription based services in industries such as music with Spotify, movies with Netflix, designers software with Adobe Creative suite. Payroll with Quickbooks. Now we envision a high tech community where Makeup would be based on the same model, utilizing a hardware gear to get the makeup job done.

We have designed this gear in the form of a mask as seen from our diegetic prototype that has a virtual interface where the user can interact with this software to complete his or her makeup. Most recently, we have seen celebrities influence particularly the fashion industry, for example, Rihanna with Fenty and Kim Kardashian with popularizing drag makeup.

## REFLECTIONS
- Critically think about why VR/AR and the impact of the design.
- Speculative design in order to critically engage with possible and future worlds.
- Focusing on story-telling for the presentation is critical for conveying the idea to the audience.
