Given social distancing and new conduits of interaction we now face the question of how to share and enjoy beverages in a post-COVID world.\nThe vision is to:\nshare product knowledge and support responsible enjoyment of products from a creative marketing approach drive customer engagement using experiential, personalizaed methods emphasize and design for the spirit of social interaction and inclusiveness that is currently being hindered in the COVID environment We also sought to produce a product that aligns with LCBO’s corporate vision: “To deliver remarkable experiences as the trusted destination for the world’s wines, beers and spirits.”\nRESEARCH Our project has taken place in a groundbreaking time, and because of this, thorough research was even more essential. We completed a lot of secondary research covering beverage alcohol market analysis, pandemics \u0026 isolation, existing food \u0026 drink applications and more.\nSecondary Research Increased sales Sales of all alcohols have increased during this time (no surprise). Most notably there were increased sales in large format alcohol, “multi-packs, bag-in-box wine, and bottles over 750 mL”. Virtual bars and happy hours Platforms such as zoom, houseparty, and google hangouts are hosting virtual happy hours after work. For example the Newyork state brewers association launched a virtual happy hour that will take place on different brewery’s Facebook pages everyday, focusing on a particular topic or game. Leverage technology Young consumers need a platform or product experience to help them create instagrammable moments. Encouraging creativity at home. Luckily, we were also able to connect with Henry Cowie of Bartesian - a local startup that produces a one of a kind “Keurig for Cocktails”. He had a wealth of market knowledge from years of working in the beverage alcohol industry. And he gave us insights about upcoming trends with Millennial and Gen Z consumers, including beverage consumption preferences and behaviours. Henry’s Input Consumers had a lot of word of mouth spreading the brand. Ready to drink mixes and cocktails were increasing in sales just before the lockdown. Vast majority of cocktailes made at home are deconstructed cocktails. (Easy for consumers to understand the character of each ingredient and how it influences the cocktail) Cocktails are not viable for party drinking - not going to get used or you’re going to be busy. We then deployed a survey that helped us fill in gaps in our knowledge about consumers attitudes and behaviours before COVID, and how things have changed since the pandemic began. This data confirmed our assumptions about drinking behaviours, and highlighted a lot of pain points around social interactions during the pandemic. Survey Insights We received 81 responses from outreach done in our personal circles, personal posts on social media, and survey swap groups on Facebook.\nClimate Potentially unstable income and higher levels of stress. Target Users Ontarians age 19 - 35 who consume alcoholic beverages and have digital solutions permeating daily lives \u0026 routines. Motivations More drinks for dinner and stocking up. Less party drinks, more relaxing and casual drinks. Behaviours Purchasing more online, and less often overall. PROPOSALS \u0026 USER FLOW Product Proposals At the end of our initial ideation stage, we found the common goals of the users are\nit’s more fun sharing a drink with friends or family wide selection of products .. while the common frustrations are it can be overwhelming to decide on a a product virtual socializing can’t replace the real thing 1. Redesign \u0026 Revamp create a more comprehensive and efficient browsing experience mobile platform that feels more intuitive, personalized an engaging 2. Match, Mix \u0026 Meet help facilitate desired social interactions increase user-engagement around product knowledge and empower users 3. Playful Products \u0026 Practice address lack of positive stimulation and desire to safely try new things gamify product information and application (i.e. following recipes and practicing mixology skills) Value Proposition Become the resident bartender for your social circle. Effortlessly track, discover, and share your beverages with friends in a fun way. Always know what you have in your home-bar collection and how to make the most of it. User Flow We had three ideas that played to the needs and pain points. And then we jumped into creating wireframes and a flow that included all of these functions. Key Features 1. Better Product Inforamtion \u0026 Access include more relevant and helpful information on product pages\n2. Beverage Discovery \u0026 Mixing explore mixology and recipes\n3. Easy Party Planning \u0026 Sharing of Beverages socialize over beverages digitally with social interactions in an app, and helpful planning tolls for meeting in person\nDESIGN DETAILS I approach design by proposing design questions at different points along the user flow. In this case, I’ll give three examples and how I iterated the designs.\nDesign question 1: how to create a homepage of great user onboarding? Version 1: This first design style was intended to immerse users in the idea of having their very own ‘home bar’ with displayed on a shelf accompanied by some snazzy furniture. One of the users said he liked these warm and unique visuals, reminding him of classic pub. However, in the testing, some users can not recognize the buttons to click and it took more time for them to clearly know the information structure, which made them feel lose control.\nVersion 2: So, the design team decided to pivot to a more conventional design. Not only to meet the better usability for users, but also to cut down on the workload of the team’s graphic design as well as iterative process. Pivot was the right choice. The stakeholders liked this flat and neat design. In terms of content, they wanted a more creative homepage which introduces and emphasizes our distinctive feature, instead of an intended selling page with the featured products.\nVersion 3: This version included more navigation such as the auxiliary navigation bar and featured collection in terms of occasions for users to quickly onboarding. Both users and stakeholder loved this version. One of the stakeholder said it was easier to find and explore our unique feature. From the test of 6 participants, we got mean of usability score 7.3/10, and mean of visual appeal rating 8.8/10.\nDesign question 2: how to improve effectiveness of browsing? Version 1: Scroll vertically to see the four catergories of alcohol beverages. Scroll horizontally to see all the beverages of each catergory. Click “see all” to get a list view. List filtering by tag. Most of the testing users could not tell good or bad of this version. The design team found scrolling vertically and horizontally not consistent. The information hierarchy is good but the page looks just nothing special or unique.\nVersion 2: Include a browse button on the bottom navigation bar. Categorize the alcoholic beverage into four image cards. Add a banner and show the category inside. Both the design team and users liked this version. But the team found a single line of tags can not fulfill so many categories and subcategories of alcoholic beverages. One of the teammate was reminding that we need to include food pairing at the search bar.\nVersion 3: Scroll left and right to see the drink categories and food pairing categories. Include filter icons to visualize the subcategories. Detailed filters overlay. In the usability test, the average time for browsing task reduced. No confusions or usability issues were brought up. Both users and stakeholders were satisfied with this version.\nDesign question 3: How to motivate users to mix and share? Version 1: Click the button “Mixology” to directly get into the mixing process. The users can select the glass, mix material and decoration to DIY their cocktail. This version is simple and clean. But most user found it confused without word description. One of the users said he preferred some visuals or words to tell what to do next and what mixology is for.\nVersion 2: Add a mixology homepage “My Bar\"to show the recipes and cocktails feed. The “My Bar” replaces the “Mixology” in the bottom navigation bar. Add an eye-catching “Mix Now!” button at the conspicuous location to start mixology. Give users two choices to make their own cocktail recipes or watch the animation showing the cocktail made by other users. This version included both gamification and education. Most users said this version was much better than the previous one. The design team still found it can be improved in terms of intuitiveness. However, due to the time constraints, we decided to come to a design freeze.\nPROOF OF CONCEPT Deep diving into the overal project results, we have proven our product value and insights.\nPositioning to consider Consider catering design to a Millennial audience of beverage consumers, and the rising trends in the GenZ market. Functions to explore Top performing functions included the Virtual Liquor collection or Home Bar, and the Mixology. Managing what is in your home bar and learning how to create drinks is still very applicable even in a post-covid world with less restrictions. We think these should be explored first before exploring the social aspects and party planning. Vision to employ With the ongoing changing climate of this covid and post-covid world, designing for the future that consumers desire is key. If LCBOnext is to pursue an endeavour in this brief or another venture related to covid, maintaining foresight and constantly checking in with how user’s attitudes and behaviours are changing is essential. Launch to pursue When considering or developing any COVID related solution, do launch for the post-covid world, but remember to design with current restrictions and safety measures in mind to best help Ontarians share and enjoy beverages in a safe way. SOLUTION DEMO A user browses new beverages with helpful information and reviews. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xkmFKQsEtrU\nA user practices mixing cocktails and makes quality drinks that she can share with friends. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cHiXgQPCnOE\nA user plans a social event with alcohol and yummy food. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-ZrQwbdEp6s\nREFLECTIONS Next Steps Improve and integrate the mixology feature. Design for multi-platform, like iPad, etc. Look for deeper digital lifestyle integration in Post-Covid world. Take-aways Stand up for my own view. I learned how to understand and respect teammates and their opinions, but not being shy about saying that I will be firm in standing up for my own views as well. And appreciate the need for cooperation and compromise in the interests of the overall project. Keep testing, learning and iterating. I iterated the project even after the capstone was finished. By collecting feedback and learning new skills, I found the product would never be “perfect”. Balance between ideal and reality. Designed in a way that serves our learning goals and portfolio desires but also pursued valuable outcomes for users and all stakeholders. ",

<p>The COVID/POST COVID environment has brought tectonic changes in the way we <strong>socialize</strong>. Given <strong>social distancing</strong> and <strong>new conduits of interaction</strong> we now face the question of how to share and enjoy beverages in a post-COVID world.</p>

The vision is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>share</strong> product knowledge and <strong>support</strong> responsible enjoyment of products from a creative marketing approach</li>
<li><strong>drive</strong> customer engagement using experiential, personalizaed methods</li>
<li><strong>emphasize</strong> and <strong>design</strong> for the spirit of social interaction and inclusiveness that is currently being hindered in the COVID environment
We also sought to produce a product that aligns with LCBO&rsquo;s corporate vision:</li>

<h2 id="design-details">DESIGN DETAILS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-details">#</a></h2>
<p>I approach design by proposing design questions at different points along the user flow. In this case, I&rsquo;ll give three examples and how I iterated the designs.</p>
<h3 id="design-question-1-how-to-create-a-homepage-of-great-user-onboarding">Design question 1: how to create a homepage of great user onboarding?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-question-1-how-to-create-a-homepage-of-great-user-onboarding">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> This first design style was intended to immerse users in the idea of having their very own ‘home bar’ with displayed on a shelf accompanied by some snazzy furniture.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230254743-9c0f66c0-9a9d-442a-9d9c-c00eca69250c.gif" alt="Q1V1"  />

One of the users said he liked these warm and unique visuals, reminding him of classic pub. However, in the testing, some users can not recognize the buttons to click and it took more time for them to clearly know the information structure, which made them feel lose control.</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> So, the design team decided to pivot to a more conventional design. Not only to meet the better usability for users, but also to cut down on the workload of the team&rsquo;s graphic design as well as iterative process.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230254746-8ed4d9dc-df53-4f5c-bece-fce157ab0f06.png" alt="Q1V2"  />

Pivot was the right choice. The stakeholders liked this flat and neat design. In terms of content, they wanted a more creative homepage which introduces and emphasizes our distinctive feature, instead of an intended selling page with the featured products.</p>
<p><strong>Version 3:</strong> This version included more navigation such as the auxiliary navigation bar and featured collection in terms of occasions for users to quickly onboarding.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230254748-f98700aa-e9da-43d4-b16e-7fa245be0652.png" alt="Q1V3"  />

Both users and stakeholder loved this version. One of the stakeholder said it was easier to find and explore our unique feature. From the test of 6 participants, we got mean of usability score 7.3/10, and mean of visual appeal rating 8.8/10.</p>

<h3 id="design-question-2-how-to-improve-effectiveness-of-browsing">Design question 2: how to improve effectiveness of browsing?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-question-2-how-to-improve-effectiveness-of-browsing">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> Scroll vertically to see the four catergories of alcohol beverages. Scroll horizontally to see all the beverages of each catergory. Click &ldquo;see all&rdquo; to get a list view. List filtering by tag.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230263876-94495249-a276-49ff-982a-b8ded9b087d9.png" alt="Q2V1"  />

Most of the testing users could not tell good or bad of this version. The design team found scrolling vertically and horizontally not consistent. The information hierarchy is good but the page looks just nothing special or unique.</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> Include a browse button on the bottom navigation bar. Categorize the alcoholic beverage into four image cards. Add a banner and show the category inside.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230263882-e69a8de7-87e7-47f1-bed7-9d8c5fec927d.png" alt="Q2V2"  />

Both the design team and users liked this version. But the team found a single line of tags can not fulfill so many categories and subcategories of alcoholic beverages. One of the teammate was reminding that we need to include food pairing at the search bar.</p>
<p><strong>Version 3:</strong> Scroll left and right to see the drink categories and food pairing categories. Include filter icons to visualize the subcategories. Detailed filters overlay.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230264365-e02178d9-5309-448d-a949-602af107e47e.png" alt="Q2V3"  />

In the usability test, the average time for browsing task reduced. No confusions or usability issues were brought up. Both users and stakeholders were satisfied with this version.</p>

<h3 id="design-question-3-how-to-motivate-users-to-mix-and-share">Design question 3: How to motivate users to mix and share?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-question-3-how-to-motivate-users-to-mix-and-share">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> Click the button &ldquo;Mixology&rdquo; to directly get into the mixing process. The users can select the glass, mix material and decoration to DIY their cocktail.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230264478-296d0870-fcc1-444a-af2a-35a9d6a5cd00.png" alt="Q3V1"  />

This version is simple and clean. But most user found it confused without word description. One of the users said he preferred some visuals or words to tell what to do next and what mixology is for.</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> Add a mixology homepage &ldquo;My Bar&quot;to show the recipes and cocktails feed. The &ldquo;My Bar&rdquo; replaces the &ldquo;Mixology&rdquo; in the bottom navigation bar. Add an eye-catching &ldquo;Mix Now!&rdquo; button at the conspicuous location to start mixology. Give users two choices to make their own cocktail recipes or watch the animation showing the cocktail made by other users.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89154660/230264484-2f3f792e-ceb0-4f93-a06b-64cbf59c4307.png" alt="Q3V2"  />

This version included both gamification and education. Most users said this version was much better than the previous one. The design team still found it can be improved in terms of intuitiveness. However, due to the time constraints, we decided to come to a design freeze.</p>

<h3 id="proof-of-concept">PROOF OF CONCEPT<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#proof-of-concept">#</a></h3>
<p>Deep diving into the overal project results, we have proven our product value and insights.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positioning</strong> to consider
Consider catering design to a Millennial audience of beverage consumers, and the rising trends in the GenZ market.</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong> to explore
Top performing functions included the Virtual Liquor collection or Home Bar, and the Mixology. Managing what is in your home bar and learning how to create drinks is still very applicable even in a post-covid world with less restrictions. We think these should be explored first before exploring the social aspects and party planning.</li>
<li><strong>Vision</strong> to employ
With the ongoing changing climate of this covid and post-covid world, designing for the future that consumers desire is key. If LCBOnext is to pursue an endeavour in this brief or another venture related to covid, maintaining foresight and constantly checking in with how user’s attitudes and behaviours are changing is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Launch</strong> to pursue
When considering or developing any COVID related solution, do launch for the post-covid world, but remember to design with current restrictions and safety measures in mind to best help Ontarians share and enjoy beverages in a safe way.</li>

And appreciate the need for cooperation and compromise in the interests of the overall project.</li>
<li><strong>Keep testing, learning and iterating.</strong> I iterated the project even after the capstone was finished. By collecting feedback and learning new skills, I found the product would never be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Balance between ideal and reality</strong>. Designed in a way that serves our learning goals and portfolio desires but also pursued valuable outcomes for users and all stakeholders.</li>
